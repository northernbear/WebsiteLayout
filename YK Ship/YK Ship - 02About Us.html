								<p><strong><span class="read-red">The Go-To Specialist in Automotive Logistics</span></strong></p>
								<p>Established in 1999, <a href="#">YK Ship Pte Ltd</a> is not your typical freight forwarding and logistics company, instead occupying a unique and lucrative niche in the market as an expert in automotive logistics, with highly customised and personalised services available to their clients.</p>
								<p><a href="#">YK Ship Pte Ltd</a> is one of the bigger car exporting forwarders in Singapore, exporting about 5,000 cars per year to various countries such as Indonesia and the United Arab Emirates. The company runs their own Export Processing Zone (EPZ) operations, where they export LTA-deregistered cars overseas, as well as a licensing warehouse for new cars imported into the country, where the vehicles go through the process of licensing by the Immigration and Customs Authority (ICA), payment of duties, and registration for use in Singapore. The company’s prowess in automotive logistics is underlined by their work towards supporting popular car exhibitions and shows in Singapore and the region, which includes Tokyo Auto Salon Singapore 2013. <a href="#">YK Ship Pte Ltd</a> also recently provided logistics support for 31 Indonesian-owned Ferrari sports cars in their participation of the Ferrari South East Asia Grand Tour 2015, a 3-day luxury event for Ferrari owners in the region, enabling these cars to be driven in Singapore and Malaysia.</p>
								<p><span class="read-red">MR EUGENE LIM</span>, <a href="#">YK Ship Pte Ltd's</a> Managing Director, revealed that one of their strengths is assisting owners and collectors of all sorts of cars, be they of the vintage and classic varieties or new and used current models, in registration and importing of their prized possessions for use in Singapore. Some of <a href="#">YK Ship Pte Ltd's</a> clients are owners who have migrated to live and work in Singapore, and would like to bring their cars with them due to the sentimental value; Mr Lim and his dedicated staff help the owners with the required inspections and paperwork so they can continue to use their beloved cars on our roads.</p>
								<p>Most of <a href="#">YK Ship Pte Ltd's</a> clients go to them for car imports and exports, and the company's highly personalised services even include sourcing and importing vintage and classic cars such as 1930s Rolls Royce models and 1920s Morris cars for clients who are avid collectors, simplifying the process for them. Some local importers also depend on YK Ship Pte Ltd for registering their vehicles, a sure sign that the company has achieved a reputation for in-depth knowledge in both technical and procedural aspects for car registration.</p>
								<p><a href="#">YK Ship Pte Ltd</a> takes great pride in providing the personal touch for their clients, treating the cars and goods as their own, and the sincerity of their actions have seen them retain and grow their clientele over the years despite increasing price competition. Mr Lim and his staff often go above and beyond what any logistics company would do, even verifying the state of the cargo using photographs and videos, sending them to their clients, before shipping it to them.</p>
								<p><span class="read-red">"These services can't be bought by money, we go the extra mile because we are passionate about our job,"</span> explained Mr Lim. Despite their focus on automotive logistics, <a href="#">YK Ship Pte Ltd</a> continues to provide logistics agency services for clients, including customs clearance, delivery and trans-shipments, bread-and-butter services for any logistics company.<br/>The company currently operates a licensing warehouse at No. 7 Penjuru Close where they house high-end cars from Italian luxury brands Ferrari and Lamborghini, as well as an export processing zone (EPZ) at Turf City for deregistered and new cars that the company exports and ships. With the allure of car ownership as high as ever, <a href="#">YK Ship Pte Ltd</a> is poised to ride the wave to further success.</p>
